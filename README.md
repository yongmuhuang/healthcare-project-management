## 🧠 Project Overview

Burnout affects over **51% of U.S. pharmacists** and has worsened since the COVID-19 pandemic. Unlike physicians or nurses, pharmacists often lack structured peer support systems, contributing to poor mental health and decreased patient safety.

The **Pharmacist Thrive Program** is a simulated capstone project that proposed a scalable, cost-effective peer support initiative to address pharmacist burnout. The project complements the **National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP)** mental health efforts by designing psychologist- and peer-led workshops and digital tools.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Provide pharmacists with burnout prevention tools and coping strategies.
